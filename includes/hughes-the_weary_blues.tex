\chapter{The Weary Blues}
\chapterauthor{Langston Hughes}
\begin{verse}
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,\\\empty{}
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}I heard a Negro play.\\\empty{}
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night\\\empty{}
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}He did a lazy sway\ldots{}\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}He did a lazy sway\ldots{}\\\empty{}
To the tune o' those Weary Blues.\\\empty{}
With his ebony hands on each ivory key\\\empty{}
He made that poor piano moan with melody.\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}O Blues!\\\empty{}
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool\\\empty{}
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}Sweet Blues!\\\empty{}
Coming from a black man's soul.\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}O Blues!\\\empty{}
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone\\\empty{}
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—\\\empty{}
\hspace{1.5em}``Ain't got nobody in all this world,\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}Ain't got nobody but ma self.\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}I’s gwine to quit ma frownin'\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}And put ma troubles on the shelf.''\\\empty{}
\vspace{1em}
Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.\\\empty{}
He played a few chords then he sang some more—\\\empty{}
\hspace{1.5em}``I got the Weary Blues\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}And I can't be satisfied.\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}Got the Weary Blues\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}And can't be satisfied-\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}I ain't happy no mo'\\\empty{}
\hspace{2em}And I wish that I had died.''\\\empty{}
And far into the night he crooned that tune.\\\empty{}
The stars went out and so did the moon.\\\empty{}
The singer stopped playing and went to bed\\\empty{}
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.\\\empty{}
He slept like a rock or a man that's dead.\\\empty{}
